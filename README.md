# 🧠 Medical RAG Agent

This project is a simple **AI agent** built using **LangGraph** that answers medical questions from a given PDF document.
It uses the **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** approach to search the PDF for relevant content and generate accurate answers.
A short reflection step is also added so the agent can check whether its answer is relevant to the question.

## Streamlit App: https://sducjqmuhqvrgcuhtmuobj.streamlit.app/

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

* **Python 3.13**
* **LangGraph** for agent workflow
* **Groq API** as LLM
* **ChromaDB** for local vector database
* **Hugging Face** for embeddings
* **LangSmith** for tracing
* **Streamlit** for the user interface

## 🧩 Project Flow

The workflow is divided into four simple steps (LangGraph nodes):

1. **plan** → Understand the user’s question and decide if retrieval is needed.
2. **retrieve** → Get the most relevant chunks from the vector database.
3. **answer** → Use the LLM to generate an answer from the retrieved content.
4. **reflect** → Check if the generated answer is relevant and complete.

Each step prints logs in the terminal, showing the progress:

## 🖥️ Environment Setup

### 1. Clone the project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/medical-rag-agent.git
cd medical-rag-agent
```

### 2. Create and activate a virtual environment (Python 3.13)

```
conda create -n langgraph python=3.13 -y
conda activate langgraph
```

### 3. Install the requirements

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Set up the environment file

Created a file named `.env` in the root folder and add the required keys:

```
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
GROQ_MODEL=llama-3.3-70b-versatile
LANGSMITH_API_KEY=your_langsmith_api_key
LANGSMITH_TRACING=true
LANGSMITH_PROJECT=Medical-RAG-Agent
EMBED_MODEL=sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2
CHROMA_DIR=./chroma_store
```

## 📘 How to Use

### Step 1 — Add the PDF or .txt file

Place the file in the main project folder

### Step 2 — Ingest the data

Run the ingestion script to process and store embeddings:

```bash
python ingest.py
```

This creates a local folder `chroma_store/` that stores all vector data.

### Step 3 — Run the agent (terminal)

```bash
python main.py
```

Example output:

```
[PLAN] {'need_retrieval': True, 'query': 'What are the symptoms of diabetes?'}
[RETRIEVE] Retrieved 3 docs
[ANSWER] Diabetes symptoms include frequent urination, increased thirst...
[REFLECT] {'relevance': 0.9, 'comment': 'Answer is relevant and complete.'}
```

### Step 4 — Run with Streamlit UI

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Then open the browser at:

```
http://localhost:8501
```

We can ask the questions and view the step-by-step process and reflection.

## 🧠 Approach

1. **PDF Ingestion** – The document is loaded, split into text chunks, and stored as vector embeddings in ChromaDB using Hugging Face.
2. **Question Understanding (Plan)** – The agent checks if the question requires retrieval.
3. **Retrieval (RAG)** – The relevant chunks are fetched from Chroma based on the question.
4. **Answer Generation** – The Groq model generates a response using the retrieved context.
5. **Reflection** – The model evaluates its own answer for relevance and completeness.
6. **UI** – Streamlit provides an easy interface to interact with the system.

This approach makes the agent explainable and traceable, with clear step outputs and validation.

## 🧾 Example Output

```
[PLAN] {'need_retrieval': True, 'query': 'What is hypertension?'}
[RETRIEVE] Retrieved 2 docs
[ANSWER] Hypertension, or high blood pressure, is a chronic condition...
[REFLECT] {'relevance': 0.95, 'comment': 'The answer directly addresses the question.'}
```

## Challenges Faced:
One major challenge was tuning the chunk overlap between document segments. Too little overlap caused the model to miss contextual information, while too much overlap increased redundancy and processing time — finding the right balance was crucial for retrieval accuracy. Another issue was managing multiple LLM calls efficiently during the reasoning flow. Each call introduced latency and token overhead, so optimizing the query structure and minimizing unnecessary LLM invocations was key to improving response speed and consistency.
